        "Why Penn Essay": "As an Electrical Engineering major with a concentration in robotics and a minor in Urban Education, I plan to use robotics to produce improved learning opportunities for marginalized students. \n\nCourses such as Learning in Robots and Signal and Information Processing will provide the necessary background to pursue research with Modlab’s revolutionary Quori project—a pioneering system for conducting Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) research. Through research with Quori on using robots as tutors, I hope to help UPenn develop its budding Social Interaction Robotics group. \n\nI will also use my experience building service robots for --- to help advance the Autonomous Service Robots project with the Lifelong Machine Learning Group. Helping develop these robots will provide excellent exposure to HRI while improving the UPenn campus experience for all students and faculty.\n\nI will use this HRI research to produce innovative solutions to urban educational concerns by pursuing a fellowship with the National Urban League through the Fox Leadership Program, using my education to fulfill my goals of creating new growth opportunities for students from under-resourced urban areas. Upenn’s blend of unique HRI opportunities and distinctive avenues for engineering societal change create the perfect launchpad for a career at the forefront of EdTech."
