The DP Foundation was established in 2023 to ensure the DP’s long-term financial sustainability, spearhead institutional advancement initiatives, and manage large assets. We are seeking to build a close-knit, collaborative team of student leaders enthusiastic about our mission. The Foundation team will work closely with professional staff and alumni to tell the DP’s story, past, present and future, generating financial support and alumni involvement that will propel the organization forward. Our work directly impacts the lives of students on staff, as well as Philadelphia’s vibrant media ecosystem.",
